# 2. Linux File Management:
## Task 1: File Permissions

- Create a directory called "testdir" and change its ownership to your user account.
- Create two files inside "testdir": "file1.txt" and "file2.txt".
- Change the permissions on "file1.txt" to allow read and write access to your user 
account and read-only access to all other users.
- Change the permissions on "file2.txt" to allow read and write access to your user 
account and read and write access to any user belonging to the same group as your user 
account.
- Take a screenshot of the "ls -l" command output for "testdir" and submit it.
